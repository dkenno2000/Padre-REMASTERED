# Padre-REMASTERED

v1.1 Still in early developement - adding features as I find time. If you find any bugs or have any ideas for more features, let me know.

## KEY FEATURES:
- Price charts (supports all token launch platforms)
- Watch Pump.fun livestreams directly from Padre
- Token image and descriptions for all supported platforms

## NOTES:
- You must enable 'X token search' under 'Customize -> Data' on Trenches for the price charts to work
- Have your 'Layout -> Display' set to 'Moxia' for the best experience

### TODO:
- switch between SOL and BSC on Trenches
- remove Show charts only for Migrated
